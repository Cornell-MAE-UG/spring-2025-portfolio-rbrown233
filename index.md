Hello, I'm Robert Brown, a rising junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. Throughout my studies and projects, I've developed a strong foundation in CAD modeling and design optimization. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of engineering and creativity, and am eager to work on impactful projects and expand the boundaries of what's possible in mechanical design.
