Hello, I'm Robert Brown, a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. Throughout my studies and projects, I've developed a strong foundation in design, analysys, manufacturing, and testing. I'm interested in designing and building complex systems with lots of moving parts, and am eager to explore new projects that expand the boundaries of what's possible in mechanical design. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
