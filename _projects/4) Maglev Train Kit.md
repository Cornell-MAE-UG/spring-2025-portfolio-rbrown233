This project centered on the design and fabrication of a custom carbon fiber splitter and canards for a Porsche 987, with the primary objective of balancing the substantial rear downforce generated by an aftermarket wing. To begin, I used the Raptor 3D scanner to obtain the exact dimensions of the car to enable accurate modeling of both the splitter and canard geometry. 3d scanners have trouble picking up smooth surfaces such as car body panels, which I solved by sticking small balls of tape around the panel. This allowed the scanner to pick up the geometry and then all I had to do was remove the tape in CAD.

After importing the geometry into Fusion I used it to design the splitter profile. This design was based off of various other splitters on the market, and conformed to the round profile of the Porsche's front bumper. I determined that a 4 inch rule was ideal, as this is where you get diminishing returns on downforce and the car becomes difficult to drive without grabbing the splitter. I performed basic hand calculations involving bernoulli's and static analysis to determine ~200 lbf on the splitter. In the future I plan to run in-depth analysis using CFD to determine what rake angle is ideal.

With the initial design complete, my focus shifted to manufacturing. I conducted research on composite layup techniques, and determined that wet layup was the only possible method due to time and resource constraints. Resin infusion would be ideal for this project, but it unfortunately wasn't viable. I fabricated a plywood prototype splitter and test-fitted to the car to verify mounting points and alignment. I also started practicing laying up carbon fiber, making small canards out of 3 layers of carbon fiber weave. After making all the nessecary preparations, I layed up the large carbon fiber splitter. I struggled a lot with removing bubbles, and even had to implement a hair dryer to blow them out. The splitter was manufactured succesfully and is awaiting installation once the Porsche is back in town.

I'm also currently working on modeling the 987. I wanted to use a 3d scanner on the whole car, but only ended up doing the front end as it really isn't meant for that large of a shape. Instead, I used fusion forms to model the car. Forms uses t-splines for modeling organic shapes, and is perfect for car bodies. Working on this has been a great learning experience as I haven't worked too much with organic shapes. Project is still in progress, current model shown below.
