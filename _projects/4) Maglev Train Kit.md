This project centered on the design and fabrication of a custom carbon fiber splitter and canards for a Porsche 987, with the primary objective of balancing the substantial rear downforce generated by an aftermarket wing. To begin, I used the Raptor 3D scanner to obtain the exact dimensions of the car to enable accurate modeling of both the splitter and canard geometry. 3d scanners have trouble picking up smooth surfaces such as car body panels, which I solved by sticking small balls of tape around the panel. This allowed the scanner to pick up the geometry and then all I had to do was remove the tape in post.

I imported the geometry into Fusion and used it to design the splitter profile. I researched various other splitters on the market to determine what shape would work best for this case. I determined that a 4 inch rule was ideal, as this is where you get diminishing returns on downforce and the car becomes difficult to drive without grabbing the splitter. I performed basic hand calculations involving bernoulli's and static analysis to determine ~200 lbf on the splitter. In the future I plan to run in-depth analysis using CFD to determine what rake angle is ideal. 

With the initial design complete, the focus shifted to manufacturing preparation. I conducted research on composite layup techniques, resin systems, and fiber orientations to determine the most suitable materials and processes. I fabricated a plywood prototype splitter and test-fitted to the car to verify mounting points and alignment. I also started practicing laying up carbon fiber, making small canards out of 3 layers of carbon fiber weave.

I then moved on to creating the carbon fiber splitter. Due to time and resource restrictions I went with the wet lay technique. Resin infusion would be ideal for this project, but it unfortunately wasn't viable. I layed the carbon fiber in my garage, and learned a lot about how to make good surface finishes. I struggled a lot with removing bubbles, even having to implement a hair dryer to blow them out. The splitter isn't installed yet due to the porsche not being in town, but once it is the part can be validated on track.

I'm also currently working on modeling the 987. I wanted to use a 3d scanner on the whole car, but only ended up doing the front end as it really isn't meant for that large of a shape. Instead, I used fusion forms to model the car. Forms uses t-splines for modeling organic shapes, and is perfect for car bodies. Working on this has been a great learning experience as I haven't worked too much with organic shapes. Project is still in progress, current model shown below.
