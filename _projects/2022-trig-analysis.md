As a member of the arm subteam on Cornell Mars Rover, I've been designing and manufacturing custom cycloidal gearboxes in order to move away from using off-the-shelf Laiful Harmonics. Gearboxes are an integral part to armâ€™s function, as they allow the actuators to rotate at a reasonable speed and also increases torque output. Due to the size constraints of the arm, classic gearboxes are not viable and the only possible types are Harmonic, Cycloidal, and Planetary. These gearboxes all provide great gear reductions in a small size, and each come with
their pros and cons. They are also very intricate, which is why we currently are using purchased
harmonic gearboxes. These perform great, but as these gearboxes are so integral to the arm it is
more in the spirit of project teams to create them ourselves. 

Aenean faucibus luctus est, sed bibendum tellus. Nulla et magna urna. Morbi a ipsum sollicitudin, rhoncus risus volutpat, ultricies nunc. Quisque mollis finibus ante id imperdiet. Quisque vehicula elit sit amet felis facilisis fermentum.


This is how I solved the problem:

```python
    some code = 10;
    plot();
```

Aenean tincidunt aliquam arcu, in euismod dui dapibus eu. In placerat, mi et ultrices consequat, quam ligula cursus mauris, in semper neque nibh at est. Maecenas hendrerit dignissim porta. Phasellus nec fringilla dolor. Etiam efficitur nisi sit amet velit pharetra feugiat. Etiam ultrices turpis at leo semper, eleifend scelerisque neque malesuada. Aliquam molestie congue rhoncus. Donec blandit neque dolor, nec tristique mi pretium ac. Mauris tincidunt ullamcorper magna, nec pellentesque mi sagittis quis.
