Arm 2025 is a 6 DOF robotic arm that we developed for URC 2025. Quick run down: 6 Maxon DC brushless motors drive Laiful harmonic gearboxes attached to CNC'ed Aluminum joints and carbon fiber tubes. We uses MJ Bots' moteus-r4 for brushless motor control, and implemented a modular end effector swapping system. The main focus for this arm was incrimental improvements and knowledge transfer, which is why my main project consisted of developing cycloidals for future arms. This ideology allowed us to assemble and test the arm earlier than ever before, which was great for building hands-on expertise. My work for this arm consisted largely of assembly, repair and actuator integration, as well as redesigning some new potentiometers and joints.

Early in the semester, I improved access to set screws in the small actuator stacks by experimenting with drilling and ultimately cutting access slots with the band saw. I also modidified our custom potentiometer design to fit the small actuators (custom potentiometers was another new idea that we're still pursuing for 2026), and designed new mounts to allow the wrist rotate to interface with large gearboxes.

As the new arm was brought online, I solved some problems with actuators slipping and processing by loctiting loose screws. I also helped with arm testing, through which we both verified certain arm functionalities and identified some of the problems mentioned. I also assisted in soldering new XT30 connections after connectors broke during repairs. When the elbow rotate motor failed, I helped with diagnostic testing to separate gearbox issues from control tuning.
