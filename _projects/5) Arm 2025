For arm 2025, we decided to focus on incrimental improvements and knowledge transfer, which is why my main project consisted of developing cycloidals for future arms. This ideology allowed us to assemble and test the arm earlier than ever before, the Cornell Mars Rover team designed a refined six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm that builds on past experience while introducing new features aimed at versatility and reliability. The arm incorporates a quick-swap end effector system, enabling the use of specialized tools tailored for different missions: one for precise manipulation, another for handling large and irregular objects, and a third for soil collection. To improve balance and durability, the team redesigned all joints to shift the armâ€™s center of gravity closer to its base and to simplify wiring. Additionally, they are developing torque transparency between the large and small arms, allowing operators of the scaled-down version to better perceive and interact with the environment.
Aside for the gearbox project, I also worked on arm assembly, repair, and actuator integration. Early in the semester, I improved access to set screws in the small actuator stacks by experimenting with drilling and ultimately cutting access slots with the band saw. I also modified the large potentiometer design to fit the small actuators, adjusting dimensions and verifying compatibility with existing gearboxes and screws. During the spring semester I assembled actuator stackes, dissasembled old parts and salvaged hardware that could be reused.

As the new arm was brought online, we faced a lot of problems with actuator slipping, precessing etc. To solve these problems, I applied the technically advanced procedure of "loctite will fix it". I also assisted in soldering new XT30 connections after connectors broke during repairs. When the elbow rotate motor failed, I helped with diagnostic testing to separate gearbox issues from control tuning, and I designed a new CAD mount that would allow the wrist rotate to be upgraded with a larger gearbox if needed. These contributions ensured that the arm was fully assembled, tested, and iterated upon in time for mock competition, keeping the system operational despite recurring hardware challenges.
