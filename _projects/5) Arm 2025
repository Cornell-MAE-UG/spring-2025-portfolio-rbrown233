Project Overview: 

Aside for the gearbox project, I also worked on arm assembly, repair, and actuator integration. Early in the semester, I improved access to set screws in the small actuator stacks by experimenting with drilling and ultimately cutting access slots with the band saw. I also modified the large potentiometer design to fit the small actuators, adjusting dimensions and verifying compatibility with existing gearboxes and screws. During the spring semester I assembled actuator stackes, dissasembled old parts and salvaged hardware that could be reused.

As the new arm was brought online, we faced a lot of problems with actuator slipping, precessing etc. To solve these problems, I applied the technically advanced procedure of "loctite will fix it". I also assisted in soldering new XT30 connections after connectors broke during repairs. When the elbow rotate motor failed, I helped with diagnostic testing to separate gearbox issues from control tuning, and I designed a new CAD mount that would allow the wrist rotate to be upgraded with a larger gearbox if needed. These contributions ensured that the arm was fully assembled, tested, and iterated upon in time for mock competition, keeping the system operational despite recurring hardware challenges.
