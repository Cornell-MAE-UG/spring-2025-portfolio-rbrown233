Project Overview:

After succesfully creating a 3D printed cycloidal gearbox, I moved on to designing a gearbox that could be manufactured out of metal. This is important as a metal gearbox will increase efficiency (only 66% in 3d printed version) and will be much more robust. This introduced a problem however, as I have limited access to CNC machining which is integral to most cycloidal gearbox design. Due to this, my new goal was to create a cycloidal with as little CNC parts as possible

Preliminary Calculations:

I performed new calculations, and acknowledging the low efficiency, increased the gear ratio to 25:1. I also looked into the bearing loads, and found only a 1.5 FOS for the radial loads, which is something that I'm monitoring.

Design:

I succesfully designed a cycloidal gearbox that only requires one CNC part (the case, which is shown 3d printed), by making use of a lot of laser cut sheet metal parts that are stacked and arranged in the ways nessecary. This involves a new idea of how to create the eccentric shaft by stacking aluminum plates, which previously could only be machined on a CNC or track lathe. I also machined one part of the input shaft myself on a Lathe and Mill.
