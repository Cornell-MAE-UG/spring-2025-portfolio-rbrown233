Project Overview:

MAE 2250 is a class in which students learn the principles of design, and it includes a group based design project that spans the whole semester. We decided to create a cord winder, a modular device that allows users to store cords efficiently and ergonomically.

The end product was fully functional, but our initial prototype was very problematic. Seeing problems such as flimsy connectors and jerky rotation, I pioneered significant changes such as adding arcs for slotting the two housing pieces together as well as adding tolerance to the lower gear mechanism.
